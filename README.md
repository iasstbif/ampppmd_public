## Antimicrobial Metabolites Producing and Plant Growth Promoting Microbial Database (AMPPPMD)

### A database of culturable bacteria and actinobacteria prevalent in protected forest ecosystems and commercial Tea plantation of Northeast India

Antimicrobial Metabolites Producing and Plant Growth Promoting Microbial Database (AMPPPMD) is a collection of bacterial and actinobacterial accessions from microorganisms prevalent in protected forest ecosystems and microorganisms associated with Tea (Camellia spp.) plants grown in commercial Tea estates and other natural ecological niches of Northeast India. With an ever-growing number of microbial accessions being submitted, it facilitates the analysis of their morphological and biochemical parameters, metabolite production, antagonistic activities along with sequence analysis and alignment search within available accessions using BLAST. The database enables us to search and data mine for microbes with their taxonomic information. AMPPPMD is equipped with various visualization tools for instant comparison in geospatial and taxonomic distribution of the microbes.
